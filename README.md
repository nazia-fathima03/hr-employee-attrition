The project works on data collected over the past 6 years and gives information about the attrition rate in XYZ company. We have used ML algorithms to help us give an efficient solution so the company HR Dept can be well prepared and take necessary steps to retain or come up with better solutions to reduce the attrition rate.

The outcome of the project is a classification is whether a employee is going to quit or no.
